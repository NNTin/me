https://github.com/NNTin/d-back/pull/14

the package d-back is utilized by discord bots. They can have different python and websockets version. During my integration into the Discord Bot I could see it is working. However it is only working for my version.

Thus extensive tests were added, http and websocket connection was validated and an allure test report is generated which is shown on Vercel.
