Create me a prompt for GitHub Copilot. My project is a SPA using npm, typescript and esm. My project is missing e2e + unit testing. I need the CoPilot to create me a structure without any tests written yet. I need the following requirements. The tests can be run with GUI and in headless mode since they will be executed in CI. With GUI/browser is needed for local debugging. The tests are divided into: Critical tests: These tests show something is wrong with the basic functionality the code has no control over. They cannot be fixed within the source code and depends on third parties. Normal tests: These tests are short tests that can be run fast. Long run tests: These tests are only executed on the CI since they consume too much time. Locally they are ignored. The tests are further divided into being active and inactive because not all tests are working out of the box and need to be activated once they are ready. Furthermore I want to have a test driven development so new tests may be specified without the actual implementation written for it yet. The tests should be able to run in parallel in CI. There will be a strategy matrix so sporadic test fails can be tested. Furthermore the test results of the different runs are collected together and finally presented via Allure Reports with Vercel integration. Furthermore the tests supports mocking as well as holding mock data. I want to do unit testing and e2e testing. Create me a structure for the extensive testing with out actually writing any tests for them yet. Only provide mock tests to demonstrate the functionality. They will be specified later after I have a structure and it is running in the CI pipelines as I expect. Feel free to pick out a testing framework suited for it best. As you are creating the structure you can ask back for feedback how I envision the testing structure to work.
The tests lives inside tests directory. The CI is via Github Actions. Playwright should only run against Chromium. The test metadata is done via tags or annotation (e.g. @critical, @long), not via folders.

For the e2e testing we cannot rely on the DOM alone if the test is successful. The reason is a large part of the game logic is in the rendering of the canvas.
Therefore for the canvas rendering logic we need to log game events and have the tests analyze that.
