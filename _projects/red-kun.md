**Red-kun** was my contribution to the [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) ecosystem â€” a powerful, modular Discord bot framework built with Python. Red-kun focused on simplifying deployment by offering a **one-click Heroku setup**, making it easier for new users to get started without worrying about hosting or server configuration.

Think of it like this:  
**Red-DiscordBot** + **Heroku** = **Red-kun**

### ðŸš€ What Red-kun Did

- Enabled **Heroku one-click deployment** for Red-DiscordBot
- Abstracted away the trickier parts of setup, such as environment configuration and token management
- Served as an on-ramp for non-technical users to start running their own Red bot instances

### ðŸ¤– About Red-DiscordBot

Red-DiscordBot itself is a highly modular framework for building feature-rich bots. It supports installing and managing **custom cogs at runtime**, which makes it incredibly flexible. Over the years, I ran multiple Red instances and:

- Installed and tested **third-party cogs** from the wider community
- Developed **my own custom cogs** to meet specific moderation and automation needs
- Helped maintain communities â€” sometimes with over **5,000 users** â€” powered entirely by Red

I spent a lot of time fine-tuning configurations, experimenting with new workflows, and helping others navigate the more advanced parts of the framework. Red's cog system is powerful but not always beginner-friendly, so having the right config made all the difference.

### ðŸ’¾ Sunset of My Cog Repository

At one point, I maintained my own public cog repository â€” but eventually chose to remove it. The community around Red-DiscordBot had grown significantly by then, with no shortage of talented cog developers. Rather than maintain my own slice of the ecosystem, I focused more on using and configuring the platform to support large communities.

### ðŸŒ± Community Impact

Through Red and Red-kun, I helped several Discord communities **grow and scale**, offering tooling that automated moderation, role management, content delivery, and more. It was a hands-on way to blend code, infrastructure, and community building â€” all within the Discord ecosystem.

While Red-kun was a relatively small tool, it served as a gateway into a much larger framework that taught me a lot about bot architecture, modular design, and supporting large-scale online communities.
