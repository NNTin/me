### ðŸ§ª Research Assistant â€” Real-Time Communication with Crossbar & Discord

During my time as a research assistant, I explored **real-time networking** using [Crossbar.io](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar), an open-source platform for distributed and microservice applications. Crossbar implements the **Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)** and supports a **Pub/Sub** architecture â€” perfect for event-driven systems.

In my spare time, I built [discord-web-bridge](/../../discord-web-bridge), a project that connects a **Discord bot/server** with a browser-based **embeddable chat client**. The idea was to let websites host a live chat interface powered by Discord, using Crossbar as the real-time messaging layer between frontend and backend.

#### Highlights:

Developed a full-stack real-time communication system using WAMP over WebSockets.

Used Crossbar to handle Pub/Sub messaging between the browser client and Discord bot.

Designed the project to be modular and embeddable â€” a plug-and-play chat widget for any website.

Learned a lot about system architecture, WebSocket communication, and integrating external APIs like Discord.
