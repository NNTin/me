**dev-tracker-reddit** is a lightweight Reddit bot that highlights comments from specific users â€” typically game developers â€” within threads. The goal was to make it easier for large communities to spot valuable insights or updates that often get buried in busy discussions.

While the script itself is small, it had a noticeable impact in several game-related subreddits where dev comments are easily missed. By surfacing those replies, the bot helped shift attention back to the people actually building the games.

The bot includes a **one-click Heroku deployment**, making it easy for others to run their own instance. I also created a short **video tutorial** to walk through setup and usage: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03nSVgs6GXw).
