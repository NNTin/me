**crosku** is a small but useful project that enables one-click deployment of a Crossbar.io instance on Heroku. Crossbar.io is an open-source networking platform designed for distributed and microservice applications. It implements the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP), providing a scalable, robust, and secure messaging backbone.

This deployment makes it easier to spin up a Crossbar server quickly, which is a key component in my larger project, [discord-web-bridge](../discord-web-bridge). Crossbar handles real-time communication between the Discord bot/server and the browser-based chat client in that system.

While crosku itself is a lightweight utility, it served as an important stepping stone by simplifying infrastructure setup and enabling faster iterations on the broader real-time communication architecture Iâ€™m building.
