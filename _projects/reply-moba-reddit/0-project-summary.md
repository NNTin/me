### 🧠 Project Summary: Reply-Dota-2-Reddit

**Reply-Dota-2-Reddit** was my first Python project — a Reddit bot that automatically replies to posts containing Dota 2 match or player links. At first, it was a single large script, but as I learned more about Python and object-oriented programming, I refactored it into a more modular and maintainable codebase.

- 🔗 I started by using the **Steam API** and later integrated the **OpenDota API** to get more detailed data.
- 🛠️ To interact with Reddit, I used **PRAW** (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for real-time replies.
- 🧾 The bot detects when users post a match or player link, fetches the relevant data, and replies with a summary of the match or player.
- 💡 This project helped me move from scripting to designing better-structured code and working with external APIs.
- 🎮 After deepening my knowledge, I created a similar Reddit bot for the **League of Legends** community, this time connecting to the **Riot API**.
