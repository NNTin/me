This website is a place to document my programming journey. Most of the projects here are older hobby projects I built before becoming a professional software engineer. They were driven by curiosity, passion, and late-night inspiration — and helped shape my path into tech.

It doesn’t cover my professional work or other tech hobbies like 3D printing, home networking, or building a media server. Nor does it include my time in RuneScape 2 or Old School RuneScape.

Since going pro, side projects have been rare — but with this site, I hope to change that and explore AI a bit more.

Fittingly, this site (and even this text) was created with the help of AI. With a deeper understanding of software now, I can focus more on project ideas and architecture. I’ve gone from just coding to shaping and building complete ideas.
