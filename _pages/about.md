Welcome to my little home on the web. I'm a ~~software engineer~~ **tin**kerer from Germany who likes to automate things and occasionally break stuff in the process.

The [projects timeline]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) shows the full journey from 2016 to today.

## Beyond Code

I’m an adventurous soul who loves exploring new places, tasting great food, and getting lost in nature. When I’m not out and about, you’ll find me practicing parkour, gaming, or unwinding with a good movie.

If you're into similar tech stuff, want to chat about old-school projects, or just feel like grabbing a coffee or beer, hit me up! You can find all my socials in the sidebar.
